## Hey there! I'm Joshua Guico ðŸŽ®ðŸ‘¾

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My journey into tech and game development started with a childhood dream of becoming the worldâ€™s strongest PokÃ©mon champion. When I realized that PokÃ©mon didnâ€™t exist in the real world (tragic, I know ðŸ˜…), I found the next best thingâ€”creating worlds, characters, and adventures through video games. Now, Iâ€™m fully immersed in my passion, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science (Games) at the University of Southern California, where I'm blending technical expertise with creative game design to build the kind of immersive, dynamic games that five-year-old me would have marveled at.

## ðŸ”­ What Iâ€™m Currently Working On:
Iâ€™m developing Scythe of Sidereal, a 2D top-down action game where players face waves of enemies, culminating in mini-boss battles that offer unique moral choices. Players can choose between defeating their mini-bosses or being worshiped by them, which adds an intriguing layer of gameplay and strategy. My primary focus is refining enemy movement and crafting fluid, challenging gameplay mechanics in Unity to keep players engaged.

## ðŸŒ± What Iâ€™m Learning:
I'm always on the hunt for new knowledge to refine my game development skills. Right now, Iâ€™m sharpening my expertise in:

- C++/C# for real-time game mechanics.
- Algorithms and Data Structures to optimize game performance and AI behavior.
- Game Design and Productionâ€”I love bringing both technical and creative elements together to craft compelling narratives and engaging gameplay.
My coursework in interactive entertainment, software development, and game programming has been pivotal in my growth as a developer. I'm also diving deep into version control (hello, GitHub!) and using industry-standard tools like Unity2-/3D, VS Code, and Eclipse to bring my ideas to life.

## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m Looking to Collaborate On:
I thrive in creative, collaborative environments and am always excited to work on projects that:

- Blend storytelling with interactive gameplay. I'm passionate about games that evoke emotions and challenge players to think.
- Focus on AI development for dynamic in-game behavior. I love tweaking AI to create intelligent, engaging opponents!
- Push the boundaries of immersive game mechanicsâ€”anything that involves unique combat systems, player choice integration, or nonlinear storytelling.

## ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m Looking for Help With:
Iâ€™m eager to expand my knowledge in site reliability engineering and backend technologies that can enhance multiplayer and live-service game experiences. If you're experienced in these areas, Iâ€™d love to chat and learn!

## ðŸ’¬ Ask Me About:
- Game development (especially in Unity, C++, and C#).
- My experience leading the AAPI in Entertainment initiative, where I organized monthly events to celebrate the intersection of entertainment (particularly video games) and Asian American culture.
- How to design a game with engaging mechanics and deep player interaction.

## âš¡ Fun Fact:
When I was a kid, my brother and I bonded over playing PokÃ©mon on the Gamebody Advance and DS. That childhood bond over games is what ignited my dream of one day working in the game development industry. Today, Iâ€™m channeling that same energy into building games that inspire joy, imagination, and adventureâ€”just like the ones that shaped my childhood.

Let's create worlds where players can lose themselves, stories that resonate, and mechanics that challenge. If you're interested in game development, whether youâ€™re an artist, sound designer, or fellow programmer, Iâ€™d love to connect and collaborate!
